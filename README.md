##### gems (GLYCAM Extensible Modelling System) is a scripting interface to [GMML](https://github.com/rtdavis22/GMML). It contains functionality similar to AMBER's LEaP.

Scripts in gems are written in JavaScript and run using Google's [V8 JavaScript Engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8).

### Getting Started
To create the executable:
```
    ./configure
    make
```

Run 'sh autogen.sh' first if you don't have a configure file.

You can find sample gems scripts in the [examples](./examples) directory.
